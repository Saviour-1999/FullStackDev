# FullStackDev
Used Technologies: Java-Spring Boot, MySQL, TypeScript-Angular, JWT
This project was done as a learning experience, Wanted to replecate a social media site on my own.
Here I've firstly created the required Databases and tables and added the foreign keys, then I've completed building the Backend microservices.
create the whole framework, controllers,dtos,service and repositories and added logics for pageable.
after that I've added a JWT authentication( took reference for this).
then I've completed the UI part using angular.and connected the backend with it. Also created the object classes and httpParams to send the correct endpoint request.
Thanks!
